## Human Supercomputer
Turn your class into a supercomputer.
![Titan Node](https://github.com/suzannepk/Human-Supercomputer-/blob/gh-pages/HumanComputer.png)
**This is one node of Titan, the most powerful supercomputer for open science in the world. It has a cpu with 16 processing elements and a gpu with 100’s of steaming multi-processors, that when programmed properly can do the work of 10s of cpus. Titan has 18,688 nodes. Together they can achieve well over 20 quadrillion calculations per second. For more details about how to turn your class in to a Titan node explore the lesson plans and materials below.**

## Instructions and Lesson Plans
Form your dual-core laptop to the world’s most powerful supercomputers, processing speed is gained by dividing tasks up between many processing elements. This is called parallel processing. 

The object of the following exercise is to introduce the concepts of parallel programming and parallel processing by turning your class or group 
into the components of a computer and implementing a simple program on them. 

For human supercomputers who have had basic geometry, the exercise in the link below will “program” them to estimate the value of Pi using 20 games of darts. This exercise is called *Monte Carol Pi*.

For human supercomputers of any age, there is a “program” that turns the class into a parallel origami generator. This exercise is called *Origami Rabbit Race*.

Follow this link to find instructions, lesson plans and for how to set up your class as a human supercomputer.
